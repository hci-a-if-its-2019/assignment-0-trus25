## List of Websites/Apps With UI That are Kinda Hard to Understand
1. [Lazada](https://www.lazada.co.id/)
2. [Share ITS](http://share.its.ac.id/)
3. Blender
These 3 are the kind of websites/apps that are really hard to understand, unless you visit/use it frequently.
## 1. [Lazada](https://www.lazada.co.id/)
Lazada Indonesia is an online shopping site that offers various types of products, ranging from electronics, books, children's toys and baby equipment, medical devices and beauty products, household appliances, and traveling and sports equipment.

Lazada is currently one of the most popular online shop in Indonesia, largely because of the fair price and huge discount. The thing I want to talk about is it's main website UI. Usually when people talk about Lazada they would think of the mobile application, I personally think the app itself is not that good, but the main website is even confusing. It's just messy, i cant even see the products properly because they're jumbled up together. And the thumbnails are so small.

**Solution**: from the perspective of a buyer I think they should make the list with page, and make it more organized with bigger thumbnail so I wont overlook any product that may seem interesting.

## 2. [Share ITS](http://share.its.ac.id/)
Share ITS is an E-learning website provided by ITS which is similar to google classroom.

Share ITS has UI that makes it hard to use it, especially finding the course. The menu for faculty is grouped together with one another which make it hard to find where my department is.

**Solution**: I think they should just make it a dropbox menu rather than thumbnail or make the thumbnail more organized and bigger so that it will be easier to find any department.

## 3. Blender
Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation.

This app is actually really good despite being free, although the UI is really hard to understand. When someone use it for the first time they would just break the toolbars. We can only use this app freely if we can remember all the hotkeys.

**Solution**: Maybe include the list of hotkeys in the folder when downloading the app
